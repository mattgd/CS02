Seven Day Tour

You are a normal human being with a daunting task: you must travel to six
continents in seven days. You have to make your way from Seattle, Washington to
Melbourne, Australia, stepping foot on every continent along the way.

The six continents are: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

You are given 10,000 USD, which you may need to exchange for local currency at
certain stops. You may travel the world in the order of your choosing. Each
continent, excluding the starting continent, North America, and the ending continent,
Australia, have multiple options of cities you can stop in. Some stops may be
quicker than others. Without a strategy, the time may run out, and you may not
be able to complete the task.

There are three possible modes of transportation: by plane, by boat, and by car.
Each option has its pros and cons. Planes are the fastest option if everything
goes to plan, but they are expensive, and can be delayed, or have layovers.
At first, a boat may be the slowest options, but they are cheap, and the only
delay may be having to reroute because of a storm. Cars are only available for
some trips. They are also cheap to rent, but they can break down easily. All
three of the options, planes, boats, and cars, can be stopped by security or a
military at any point.

Plane - layover, stopped by security, delays, storms, expensive
Boat - stopped in ports, storms, slow, cheap, only available at some stops
Car - stopped by military, at borders, break down, cheap unless it breaks down
