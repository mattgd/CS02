# Seven Day Tour

##Cycle Reflection
I made a considerable amount of progess on Seven Day Tour. It's a lot of work and organization, but it's definetly something I could get completely functional with several more hours of work. I still need to write the other travel methods (boat, car), which should be easier now that I understand how I want to approach it, and add to the story. This is definetly something that I plan to continue working on outside of this class cycle.
